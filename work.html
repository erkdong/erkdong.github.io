          As one of the first members of a new team formed within this group, my
          role involved heavy cross-functional collaboration, project
          leadership, and mentorship of junior engineers. Some notable work:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-2">
          <li>
            Added a rich suite of deal-related actions for buyers and sellers,
            reducing deal turnaround time and increasing user quality of life.

            Offered PDF download for marketplace deals, which required a custom

          I began my Google career here, rapidly learning and growing thanks to
          a complex, established product, an abundance of impactful work, and
          great mentorship. Towards the end of my time here, I was working
          fairly independently on larger projects. One such project integrated
          our product into Search Ads 360, a separate advertising platform that
          enabled advertisers outside of Google Ads (e.g. Yahoo, Bing, etc.).

          I built and maintained web apps that supported the development of the

            An app that visualized the data coming out of Hyperloop simulations

            real time.

            A web tool used by internal engineers to design the structure and
            mechanics of a Hyperloop system. The science behind the tool was
            handled by a Python application developed by a colleague.

          My most exciting project was integrating the video player into Yahoo

          highlights and clips from the sports world.
